A simple chip-8 emulator in C#. 

This is an emulator project developed for the 2022 Give campaign course of the week: Fundamentals of creating an emulator. It currently supports both the chip-8 opcodes and the Super-Chip (schip) opcodes. 

If you are interested in following along, the following tags may be of interest:
* TemplateToStartWith: This is the basic template that we started the course with. It defines an interface for the emulator, but provides no implementation. 
* EmulatorCourseEnd: This is how far the class got. It implements sufficient opcodes to display the IBM logo from the included ROM. If you want to continue from where the course left off, this is the tag to choose.
* SupportRockPaperScissors: This adds sufficient opcodes to get the Rock, Paper, Scissors ROM to work. It's still not a complete chip-8 implementation, but adds input and font display.
* FinishChip8OpCodes: This finishes off the chip-8 opcodes and adds support for all chip-8 ROMs!
* SchipSupport: Adds schip opcodes, hi res display, larger font, etc.
